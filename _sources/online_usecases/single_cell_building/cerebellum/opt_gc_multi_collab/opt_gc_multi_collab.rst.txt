Multi compartmental Cerebellar Granule cell running on the collab
#################################################################

Multi compartmental Cerebellar Granule cell optimization, performed with BluePyOpt, direcly on the collab (Code and testing - Stefano Masoli PhD). 
The ionic channels mechanisms, the passive properties and the morphology were taken and adapted from a previous published granule cell model (Diwakar et al., 2006) (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/showModel.cshtml?model=116835) and used in the automatic reconstruction and validation of the granule cells, using the BBP Optimizer Framework (Masoli et al., 2017). Information about the generation of the morphology can be found in the paper.
