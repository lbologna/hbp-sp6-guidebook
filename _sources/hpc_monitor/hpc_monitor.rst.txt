HPC Status Monitor
##################

The HPC Status Monitor allows to check the status of the HPC systems available for job
submission from the HBP Collaboratory and the remaining quotas reserved to the 
user on each of them. 

In order to run a job in the HPC systems, the HBP user needs to be
mapped on and to be part of a project on those systems.
If the user does not have any access to any systems, she/he can still submit 
jobs (with limited quotas) through the available service accounts.
For further details on the service account please refer to the dedicated 
:ref:`service_account` documentation.

*****************
HPC system status
*****************

The HPC Status Monitor top panel indicates the status of the HPC systems and whether
they provide the Service Account submission functionality (see Fig. 1).
The green/checked icon indicates that the system is running while the red cross
shows the system and/or the Service Account for that system is not currently 
available. 

The refresh and info icons, in the top right part of the panel, allow to 
update the HPC system status and open the HPC monitor Guidebook page
respectively.

*******************************
HPC system status: user details
*******************************

After clicking on any of the HPC system names in the top panel, the **User's 
Details** section unfolds and all the user's quotas on any of the HPC systems 
(including the Service Account quotas) as well as the corresponding projects
are shown (see Fig. 2). While an HPC system might be online (i.e. the green
icon is shown in the top panel) the user might not be able to submit jobs on 
that system (for example if the default node for job submission is not
available for submission). In order to check whether the user is able to submit
a job on a specific project, a **Check** button is displayed on the right side
of the quota values. The button's status changes (i.e. it turns into the green 
or red cross icon) depending on the possibility for the user to submit job at
the moment of checking.

In case the user does not have any quota on a system, or the query has not been
successful, an error message is displayed (see Fig. 3).
