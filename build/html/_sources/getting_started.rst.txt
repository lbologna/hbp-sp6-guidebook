The Brain Simulation Platform (BSP) is organized around several “Online Use Cases” and “Model Collabs”. From there, in a few clicks you will be guided to specific practical ways to use the BSP in such a way to be almost immediately productive.

Online Use Cases (workflow)

A schematic organization of their workflow is shown in the figure above. An important aspect of the workflow is that it is open to the entire neuroscience community. This means that no matter if you belong to an HBP partner Institution, an external Laboratory/Company, or you are just a curious student, you can be invited to have a HBP account and will have access to the use cases. The only restriction will be on the type of data you will able to work with, and the resources that you can use.

|

So, here are a few simple typical steps you can follow to start your project:

1. Navigate the use cases list to decide/find the one most appropriate to what you would like to do; the system will show you in some detail what is already available, based on your account accreditation;
2. Once you choose the use case, the platform will guide you to create a new collab (or join an existing one); all code and HBP-generated experimental data and models needed to execute the use case will be copied there; in several cases you can also upload and work with your own data;
3. Use your own imagination and collaborate with your team to pursue your scientific work, by using the tools already available or create new ones;
4. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can download them and/or make your work available to other users by releasing it into the HBP database; our support team can eventually also help you in creating a new use case.

This is the theory, but in practice what you can do with a use case will of course depend on your background and expertize. The BSP follows a user centric development, to enable users with different backgrounds and skill level to exploit the Platform’s capabilities to pursue scientific goals.
Also, keep in mind that use cases are constantly updated, to improve their functionalities and usability, and may require different types of resources. To help you in deciding if a specific use case is appropriate for your expertise, each one is marked with intuitive icons, indicating the expected user experience, the use case maturity, and the type of resources required. You will see these icons on the rightmost part of the use case buttons, as in the figure below:

Here is what they mean:

User experience

.. container:: bsp-container-left

    .. image:: images/getting_started/everybody_tag.png
        :scale: 70%

**End users:** interested in using the BSP infrastructure and facilities in the most user-friendly way, for relatively simple collaborative scientific projects using GUIs and public HPC resources, such as a Cloud Computing or the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG); they know the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying a neuron’s behavior (ion channels, synaptic and firing properties, etc) and understand how to run a simple simulation, but they have no background experience on programming languages such as python and/or the NEURON simulation environment.

.. container:: bsp-container-left

    .. image:: images/getting_started/poweruser_tag.png
        :scale: 70%

**Power user:** interested in using the BSP infrastructure and facilities for collaborative projects using public resources (such as the NSG), or their own HPC grants on one of the supercomputer centers supporting HBP activities (JSC and CINECA). These users are able to design, implement, run, and analyze models and simulations using the NEURON simulation environment; they understand the information needed to implement and run a simulation of morphologically and biophysically accurate neurons, and they have a working knowledge of python.

.. container:: bsp-container-left

    .. image:: images/getting_started/experts_tag.png
        :scale: 70%

**Experts and co-design partners:** users with a good knowledge of the inner working of collabs/apps/webservices and/or a substantial expertize in implementing simulations of morphologically and biophysically accurate neurons and networks to model brain functions; they contribute to the development of new use cases/models.

.. container:: bsp-container-left

    .. image:: images/getting_started/developer_tag.png
        :scale: 70%

**Code developers:** designers and early adopters of initial versions of collabs/apps/webservices/models; they are top experts in their respective ICT and/or neuroscience field. Use cases showing this icon are usually restricted to collabs with a team composed of mostly HBP partners for developing/testing advanced topics.

    A service of this maturity level has reached a certain robustness and may be used by early adopters.

.. container:: bsp-inline-text 

    A service of this maturity level is under heavy development and recommended only for specialists’ use or use for co-design partners.

    Use cases with this icon require a small to medium amount of high-performance computing resources. They can be either public, such as those available through the NSG, or provided by the user through a personal grant, such as a PRACE award.

    This type of use cases need large HPC resources, which must be provided by the user. Typically, use cases showing this icon involve complex simulations of large scale cellular level model of brain areas/regions, that are deployed on one of the supercomputer centers supporting HBP activities (JSC and CINECA). Subjected to technical compatibility and license agreement, this type of simulations can be delegated to be executed outside the BSP.
