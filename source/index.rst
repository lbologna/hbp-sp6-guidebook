The Human Brain Project Brain Simulation Platform
#################################################

The Brain Simulation Platform is part of the Human Brain Project (HBP) Platform ecosystem. It aims at providing scientists with powerful tools to reconstruct and simulate scaffold models of brain and brain tissue in a data-driven fashion. Its development is embedded in Subproject 6 of the HBP, where a tight co-design loop between science and engineering ensures the required substantial technical and scientific innovations.

As a result, the unique functionality of the Platform allows novel questions to be addressed, which could previously not be researched.
