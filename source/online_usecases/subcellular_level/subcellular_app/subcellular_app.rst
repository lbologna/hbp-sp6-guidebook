Subcellular application
=======================

The subcellular application and molecular repository were developed
as a software environment for simulation of brain molecular networks.

It was designed to reach several objectives related to major restrictions
of currently available software tools, such as the lack of integration
with existing biological data relevant for modeling and the low compatibility
of different types of models.

General info
=====================

The subcellular application was designed as a hub web based environment
for creation and simulation of reaction-diffusion models integrated with
the molecular repository.
It allows also to import, combine and simulate existing models
expressed with `BNGL`_ and `SBML`_ languages.

Two types of models are supported: rule-based models convenient and
computationally efficient for modeling big protein signaling complexes
and chemical reaction network models.

The subcellular application is integrated with a number of solvers for
reaction-diffusion systems of equations. It supports simulation of spatially
distributed systems using STEPS (stochastic engine for pathway simulation) â€“
which provides spatial stochastic and deterministic solvers for simulation
of reactions and diffusion on tetrahedral meshes.

The application provides as well a number of facilities for visualizing
the models geometry and the results of the simulations.

The molecular repository is a publicly available database of biological
information, relevant for brain molecular network modeling.

It accommodates several types of biological information which are not available
from existing public databases, such as concentrations of proteins in
different subcellular compartments of neuronal and glial cells, kinetic data
on protein interactions specific for brain and synaptic signaling and
plasticity, data on molecules mobility.

The repository is integrated with the subcellular application. They share
the same set of entities described by BioNetGen expressions. The molecular
repository can be queried from the subcellular application and the results
of the query can be added to a molecular network model.

Usage
=====================

#.  Open subcellular application by using this link: `SubcellularApp`_

|

.. image:: images/main.png

|


#.  Create a new model or load/import an existing one

    * To load a public model click the arrow to expand a list of public models
      in `Subcellular models repository`, choose one, then click `Load`

    |

    .. image:: images/load_model.png

|

    * To import `BNGL`_ or `SBML`_  model click
      `Import` in `Model` menu
    * To create a new model specify all model parameters and reaction equations
      sequentially opening and filling the tables in the `Model` menu (upper left
      of the UI). Each table corresponds to a particular section of the
      BioNetGen file of the model (with except for `Diffusions` and `Geometry`
      section). All expressions should comply with the BioNetGen language.
  
#.  Models are represented by a set of structures (e.g. compartments of models) and
    a collection of entities from the BioNetGen language such as parameters, functions, 
    molecules, species, observables and reactions. To modify these entities sof the model
    navigate to the corresponding section in the Physiology dropdown menu and specify them
    according to the BioNetGen language (for more about BioNetGen see the `official documentation <http://bionetgen.org/>`_)
  

#.  To add diffusions (required if using STEPS) navigate to the corresponding section, 
    click `New diffusion` and specify a name for the diffusive species or molecules, 
    the affected structure, the `BNGL`_ expression and the diffusion
    coefficient in m^2/s.

    |

    .. image:: images/add_diffusion.png

|

#.  To add a geometry (required if using STEPS) click `Add geometry` in
    the corresponding section: specify its name, add a `TetGen`_ tetrahedral
    mesh and a geometry specification file (geometry.json, contains
    relationship between structures and their corresponding tetrahedra and
    triangles, free diffusion boundaries and geometry scale coefficient
    converting mesh vertices position units to meters, see examples below)

    |

|

    |

    .. image:: images/add_geometry_2.png

|

#.  At any stage model can be:

    * saved using `Model` -> `Save` sequence, and then loaded from `My models`
      in `Subcellular models repository`

    |

    .. image:: images/save.png

|

    * exported into different formats by using `Model` -> `Export` 

    |

    .. image:: images/export_model.png

|


#.  To simulate a model select `Simulations` on the `Model` panel, then create
    new simulation by clicking the corresponding button.
    
    * Specify the solver (`STEPS`_ or `NFSim`_), change the default simulation parameters
    
    |

    .. image:: images/config_simulation.png

|
    
    
    * If desired add stimulations (this can be imported from a CSV or NFSim .rnf file) if needed:

    |

    .. image:: images/stimulation.png

|

    * If 3D visualization is needed, Spatial sampling parameters (sampled compartments and observables) should be specified:

    |

    .. image:: images/spatial.png

|
    
    Click `Apply` in the bottom of the form and finally `Run` to start the simulation.
    
    |

|


#.  Simulation logs and charts are available for inspection once the simulation
    is started by clicking on `Graph` or `Log` buttons.
